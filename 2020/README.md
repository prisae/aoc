# Advent of Code 2020

First days of my holidays I had a go at the first half of the puzzles. Main
objective was simply to solve the puzzle, the solutions are not optimized for
speed. They are only sparsely annotated, if at all.

I tried to solve all puzzles without searching for help. In part two of day 13
I ran off in weird directions a couple of times. All solutions worked for the
small test problems, but were too costly for the real thing. In this one I had
eventually to look at other solutions to stay sane.
